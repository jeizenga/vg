    // The pinch graph has "threads", "adjacencies", and "blocks"
    // The vg graph has "nodes" and "edges" and "paths" (again)
    
    // We have two layers of name/ID translation
    // One is from string GFA node name to pinch thread "name" number.
    // One is from pinch block pointer to vg graph node ID
    // For a GFA with no overlap and numeric names we want them to be invisible.
    // Otherwise in some places we will have to rework things.
    

    // New algorithm
    
    // If we are doing only perfect match:
    // Make a pinch thread set
    // Every sequence goes in
    // For each link
    // Discard the link if it is not all-M in any overlap it has
    // Pinch according to the link
    // Convert the pinch blocks to graph nodes
    // Sequence is always supplied by the first block member, whatever that is
    // Links with no overlap bypass the pinch graph entirely and become edges directly by fiddly lookup
    // Then create the paths by finding the each visited GFA sequence's thread in the pinch graph and translating via the blocks to vg space
    // When overlaps happen we know the overlap length in the second sequence (which arbitrarily loses)
    // And so we know what offset in the second sequence to start at
    // And if we didn't unify anything in the pinch graph we know a vg node will start/end there
    
    // If we are allowing non-perfect matches
    // Make the sequences into pinch graph paths the same way
    // Read the links' CIGAR strings and merge based on them
    // Except don't merge mismatched bases
    // Then resolve the sequences of pinch blocks the same way (since all of a block will be identical)
    // Then for the paths, when the path goes over an overlap edge, work out what offset in the next GFA sequence it ought to start at
    // And add a mapping to that vg node
    
    // So overall the algorithm is:
    // Make a pinch thread set
    // Every sequence goes in
    // For each link
    //  If doing perfect match mode, discard if not all M
    //  Compute CIGAR length in each sequence
    //  Pinch according to the CIGAR, only merging mismatches if in perfect match mode
    // Convert the pinch blocks to graph nodes
    // Sequence is always supplied by the first block member, whatever that is
    // Links with no overlap bypass the pinch graph entirely and become edges directly by fiddly lookup
    // Then create the paths by finding the each visited GFA sequence's thread in the pinch graph and translating via the blocks to vg space
    // When overlaps happen we know the overlap length in the second sequence from the link CIGAR
