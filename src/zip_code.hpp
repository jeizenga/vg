/**
 * Zipcodes are structures that store distance index information for a node in a graph.
 * Their basic structure is a vector of "codes", with one code for each snarl tree node 
 * (node/snarl/chain) that is the ancestor of the node, starting with the root-level
 * structure and going down to the node.
 * Each code has an identifier and information used to calculate distances.
 *
 * A ZipCode stores the information and can be used to create a zipcode. It can be used
 * to calculate the distance between zipcodes
 *
 * A ZipCodeDecoder is used for interpreting zipcodes to find specific values that were
 * stored in the ZipCode. A ZipCodeDecoder must be constructed from a specific zipcode.
 * Construction of a decoder occurs one code at a time, starting from the root snarl or chain, 
 * so it is possible to have a partially constructed ZipCodeDecoder, to avoid having to 
 * walk through the entire ZipCode to get the values for things higher in the snarl tree.
 * The full decoder must be constructed to get values for the node.
